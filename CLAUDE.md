# Sisyphus tickets & staff tools

Read this first. It is the map of this repo for any Claude working on it.

Sisyphus is a brewery and 90-seat comedy club in Minneapolis, owned by Sam
Harriman. The public website is a Shopify store (sisyphusbrewing.com). This
repo is everything around it: the scripts that keep ticket counts honest, the
staff web pages, and the scheduled jobs that email people.

## What lives where

- **Python scripts at the top level** do the work. Each one starts with a
  docstring saying what it does; read that before the code. They run as
  GitHub Actions, never on a server.
- **`.github/workflows/`** runs those scripts, on a schedule (cron, in UTC) or
  by hand (`workflow_dispatch`). Most only need `pip install requests`.
- **Folders with an `index.html`** (`staff/`, `manager/`,
  `exchange/`, `advance/`, `payouts/`, `css/`, `sign/`, `home/`, the comic
  game folders, ...) are static pages served by GitHub Pages at
  **https://staff.sisyphusbrewing.com/** (see `CNAME`). Merging to `main`
  publishes them. Shared styles and helpers: `staff.css`, `staff.js`.
- **`supabase/`** is the database (project `idsdwkubqnavkazlteis`):
  `migrations/` for tables and policies, `functions/` for Edge Functions.
  Apply migrations and deploy functions with the Supabase connector; committing
  a file here does not deploy it.
- **`theme/`** is a partial copy of Shopify theme files for reference and for
  building a duplicate theme. It is not the live site.
- **`tools/`** holds one-off diagnostics (read-only probes).

## The ticket flow (the core of the repo)

Tickets sell in two places that share the same seats: Shopify (the website)
and Dojour. Counts always mean Shopify + Dojour together.

- `fetch_tickets.py` pulls sales from both into Supabase.
- `sync_inventory.py` mirrors Dojour sales into Shopify inventory so the
  website never oversells. Stock is capped at 90.
- `dojour_holds.py` blocks website-sold seats on Dojour with "Website Hold"
  reservations. Dojour's 90-seat cap is shared across a run's showtimes, so
  per-show blocking has to be done with holds.
- `daily_sync.yml` runs the sync every 4 hours.

Dojour gotchas, learned the hard way:
- Dojour **rejects add-reservation calls from cloud / GitHub IPs** but accepts
  the identical call from Sam's home network. Anything that writes to Dojour
  has to run on one of Sam's computers. Reading from Dojour works from CI.
- Sam's own Dojour holds (rows with no buyer email, e.g. "Shopify Sales")
  are not sales. Leave them out of any sales or agent count; agents read every
  number as paid tickets.
- `DOJOUR_STATE` is a saved browser login (Playwright storage state);
  `login_setup.py` makes it.

## Secrets

Workflows read secrets from GitHub Actions: `SHOPIFY_STORE`,
`SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` (or `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`),
`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS`,
`FROM_EMAIL`, `DOJOUR_STATE`. Never print or commit their values.
`service_account.json` and `state.json` are gitignored for that reason.

## How to work here

1. **Find the real cause before fixing anything.** Read the failing
   workflow's log, the script, and the live data (Supabase, Shopify, the
   page itself) first. Don't guess and don't hand Sam trial-and-error steps.
   One fix per cause.
2. **Prove it works before saying it's done.** Run the tests, run the script
   in dry-run mode if it has one, open the page in Playwright on desktop and
   phone width, or query the data that should have changed. Say what you
   checked. "Should work" is not done.
3. **Tests:** `python -m unittest test_exchange_ticket test_settlement_draft test_sync_inventory test_dojour_refund test_split_and_share test_advance_auto test_sales_by_day`.
   They also run on every pull request. Tests must not depend on today's date;
   build show dates relative to now. Never skip or delete a test to go green.
   Money math, ticket counts and anything that emails customers deserve a test.
4. **Pull requests:** work on a branch, open a PR, and merge it yourself once
   checks pass. Sam does not merge.
5. **Staff-facing change** (new page, new button, new process)? Add a row to
   the `staff_updates` table so staff see it in "What's new" on `/staff/`, and
   add a tile to the staff hub for any new tool.
6. **The live Shopify theme is off limits** to direct edits. Duplicate the
   live theme, edit the copy, check it, and give Sam a preview link and the
   theme name to publish.
7. **Never email or message anyone outside Sisyphus** from a new script
   unless Sam asked for it. Scheduled emails go to booking@ or to the person
   they're about.

## Style

Code comments and emails are plain English for a non-programmer owner: say
what the thing does and why, with the date and "(Sam, <date>)" when it records
one of Sam's decisions. Keep scripts self-contained and dependency-light.
Times in workflows are UTC; note the Central time in a comment.
